		<h1>Checkpoint 1: 3 Ideas</h1>
		<h2>Topic 1: Matcha</h2>
		<p>I want to talk about the history of Matcha, where it originates from, how it is made, and maybe include a recipe on how to make a good cup of matcha latte with the right tools. I chose this topic because I love matcha and when I visited Japan I was able to learn more about good matcha compared to what we have in the U.S.</p>
		<h2>Topic 2: Chinese Mythology</h2>
		<p>My second topic is about the different zodiac signs and the mythology behind them. I want to talk about the race and the order of the different zodiacs. I think I might also delve into the different symbolism behind the zodiac signs and maybe how people use these signs to figure out their personality. I think I'll also talk specifically about the dragon since it shows up in other mythology stories. I chose this topic because I was always interested in the different signs and want to teach more people on Chinese mythological creatures.</p>
		<h2>Topic 3: Regions of a Game</h2>
		<p>My last idea was to talk about the regions of a game that I play everyday. I'm interested in this topic because while the game has a story and other aspects that make the game. I really enjoy the aesthetics and the outfits of the different regions. The different regions are also based on different countries in the world so I could compare and contrast them.</p>
